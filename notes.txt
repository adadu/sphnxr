// dev notes

Next up: encapsulate the manual network messaging into the Peer.effectHandler methods
instead of: addrBook.send(\Peer, "/effectHandler", args)
it's:  RemotePeer.effectHandler(\key, args)

After that, set up the local Peer.EffectList to copy bus information from remote Peers, using bus.index info instead of instantiating a bus on the local machine.

After that, set up PStream.send  to use that Peer.EffectList bus information so that
instead of: Pdefn(\Peer, 6, inf);
it's: Pdefn(\Peer, \reverb, inf)

After that, need to set up a way to use SynthDescLib to get control values from remote machines.

oh, and currently you can change those control values locally with:
~me.effectSet(\distortion, \postGain, 0.12);

or on a remote peer with:
~addrBook.send(\river, "/effectSet", \distortion, \postGain, 0.12);


	//effect handlers:
	// . Add Effect
	//    . take defaults for args
	//    . set different output bus
	// . Update List on local machine
	// . output list
	// . return bus.index
	// . delete effect
	// . get control value
	// . set control value
